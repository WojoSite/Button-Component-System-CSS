Button System 
  - The product designer has delivered button designs in ButtonDesigns.png.
  - You must bring the design to life and show a prototype of each button type.  

Instructions:
  - Using CSS, develop a button system to implement the designs.
  - Apply your style types to the five buttons in index.html to demonstrate the various states of the buttons. Do not add additional buttons.

Design Notes:
  - The designer strongly dislikes adding colors outside of the color palette (READ: do not add additional colors), which consists of:
    - #167C1E (a green)
    - #DA0202 (a red)
    - #A2A2A2 (a gray)
    - #FFFFFF (white). 
  - For Primary, Secondary, and Severe types: the active state color change is twice as much as the hover state color change.
  - For Disabled: there is only one state: normal (i.e. no hover or active states)
  - For Reverse: The hover state color change is the same amount change as the hover states for Primary, Secondary, and Severe. 
  - Additional button specs:
    - padding: padding: 6px 25px;
    - font-weight: 600;
    - font-size: 14px;
    - line-height: 21px;
